# Lip to Text
 
For the lip to text model we are basing it off of the LipNet model. 

Click [here](https://github.com/rizkiarm/LipNet) for more information about the LipNet model.

We enhanced the model by making it live, and using dlib as well as shapepredictor68 to detect the face and lips.

## please make sure you donwload the shapepredictor68 file and put it in this folder

### more info will be added soon
